  target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Euclid's Elements</a> has appeared<br>
  in more editions than any other books<br>
  except the Bible and is one of the most important mathematical treatises ever.<br>
  It has been translated to numerous languages and remains continuously<br>
  in print since the beginning of printing. Before the invention of the printing press,<br>
  it was manually copied and widely circulated. When scholars recognized its excellence<br>
  they removed inferior works from circulation in its favor.<br>
  Many subsequent authors, such as Theon of Alexandria, made their own editions,<br>
  with alterations, comments, and new theorems or lemmas.<br>
  Many mathematicians were influenced and inspired by Euclid's masterpiece.<br>
  For example, Archimedes of Syracuse and Apollonius of Perga,<br>
  the greatest mathematicians of their time,<br>
  received their training from Euclid's students and his Elements and<br>
  were able to solve many open problems at the time of Euclid.<br>
  It is a prime example of how to write a text in pure mathematics,<br>
  featuring simple and logical axioms, precise definitions, clearly stated theorems,<br>
  and logical deductive proofs.<br>
  The Elements consists of thirteen books dealing with geometry<br>
  (including the geometry of three-dimensional objects such as polyhedra), number theory,<br>
  and the theory of proportions.<br>
  It was essentially a compilation of all mathematics known to the Greeks up until Euclid's time.</p>
